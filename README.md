## Overview

This repository contains eleven interconnected frameworks that apply a unified methodology: **building measurement systems to make invisible institutional dynamics visible, creating accountability through transparency rather than enforcement.**

### The Core Pattern

Across diverse domains, institutions exhibit common structural dynamics that operate invisibly:
1. **Optimization target divergence** - Claiming to optimize for X, actually optimizing for Y
2. **Invisible trade-offs** - Sacrificing structural properties (reversibility, baselines, optionality) for measurable gains
3. **Invisible alternatives** - Viable solutions exist but remain undocumented
4. **Future constraints** - Present choices narrow option spaces invisibly
5. **Influence mechanisms** - Structural patterns shape decisions below conscious awareness

This framework provides operational methods for making each category visible and contestable.

## Framework Architecture

### Theoretical Foundation
- **[Political and Economic Baselines](./01-baselines/)** - Defines baseline as recoverable reference state enabling error detection
- **[Perfect Misalignment](./02-perfect-misalignment/)** - How institutions optimize for short-term objectives, eroding baselines
- **[Constraint by Simulation](./03-constraint-simulation/)** - How predictive systems narrow future option spaces

### Domain Applications
- **[Genetic Irreversibility Classification (GIC)](./04-gic-genetics/)** - Reversibility-based regulation for biological interventions
- **[Distributed Resilience](./05-distributed-resilience/)** - Agency-preserving crisis response architecture
- **[Commonwealth Public Bank](./06-public-bank/)** - Economic sovereignty preservation through public finance
- **[Democracy Vouchers](./07-democracy-vouchers/)** - Consent-based electoral funding
- **[Open Source Crisis Preparedness](./08-crisis-preparedness/)** - Comparison infrastructure for institutional accountability
- **[Open Source Algorithmic Governance](./09-algorithmic-governance/)** - Transparent alternatives to proprietary decision systems

### Measurement Systems
- **[Aletheia Engine](./10-aletheia-engine/)** - Pattern detection for narrative influence mechanisms
- **[TSSL v2](./11-tssl/)** - Trust scoring through coherence measurement

### Integration
- **[Making Structure Visible](./00-meta-framework/)** - The integrating paper connecting all frameworks

## Key Features

### Operational, Not Theoretical
Every framework includes:
- Quantified thresholds and metrics
- Implementation specifications
- Worked examples and case studies
- Code where applicable
- Legal/regulatory integration pathways

### Anti-Capture by Design
All frameworks include structural provisions preventing compromise:
- Open source requirements
- Multi-source verification
- Rotating committees
- Cryptographic audit trails
- Constituency inversion mechanisms
- Financial accountability bonds

### Adversarial Transparency
Designed to function **without institutional cooperation**:
- Publication-based accountability
- Platform-independent
- Replication-enabled
- Persistent and auditable

## Quick Start

### For Researchers
1. Read [Making Structure Visible](./00-meta-framework/) for the complete framework
2. Explore domain applications relevant to your work
3. Apply the [methodology template](./00-meta-framework/methodology-template.md) to new domains

### For Practitioners
1. Start with domain-specific framework matching your context
2. Review implementation specifications
3. Adapt anti-capture provisions to your situation
4. Document and share results

### For Policy Makers
1. Review baseline indices (PBI, EBI, GBI, CRBI) for your jurisdiction
2. Compare institutional approaches with documented alternatives
3. Evaluate using standardized comparison framework
4. Justify choices explicitly when documented alternatives exist

### For Developers
1. See `/code` directory for implementations
2. All code includes hash verification
3. Fork and extend as needed
4. Maintain open-source principle

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency Over Enforcement
Make invisible dynamics visible; let contestation emerge from visibility

### 2. Reversibility Over Optimization
Preserve ability to correct errors; prevent irreversible lock-in

### 3. Structure Over Content
Measure system properties, not individual intentions

### 4. Baselines Over Extraction
Maintain recoverable reference states enabling error detection

### 5. Measurement Over Judgment
Provide diagnostic signals for investigation, not prescriptive commands

---

## Intended Use Cases

### Academic Research
- Apply framework to new domains
- Test predictions empirically
- Validate measurement systems
- Extend theoretical foundations

### Policy Development
- Evaluate institutional proposals against documented alternatives
- Track baseline indices over time
- Implement anti-capture provisions in new institutions
- Require justification when alternatives ignored

### Institutional Accountability
- Measure optimization target divergence
- Detect baseline erosion early
- Document alternatives for comparison
- Create audit trails of choices

### AI Training Data
- Ensure alternative patterns remain in training corpus
- Prevent distributional collapse around institutional defaults
- Influence future AI-advised decision-making
- Preserve solution space diversity

### Community Organizing
- Document problem-space solutions
- Force institutional comparison and justification
- Build measurement capacity independently
- Create accountability without requiring institutional cooperation
